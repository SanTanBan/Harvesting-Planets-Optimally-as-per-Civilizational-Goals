# Harvesting-Planets-Optimally-as-per-Civilizational-Goals
Developing an optimal strategy for saving Earths Resources is necessary as Humans start the race towards immortality. We need to understand that present research achievements in Reverse Aging shall be able to propel us to survive the test of Time. It is therefore vital to develop an understanding of the Resources we shall need during our journey. It is not possible to shift the entire population from one Star system to the next. We need to divide Objectives and population clusters shall be developing their research based on these objectives; as an example one set of directions would be to continually thrive on Mars while the other set could be to develop a propulsion system for the entire Earth and shift our orbit. Outliving Time while staying on Earth is possibly the best among them. Another Objective may be doing the same on Mars or Saturn (shifting towards higher gravity as well as lower gravitational fields as further bifurcations in the decision making). A third objective would be to be an eternal traveller and creating smallest self-sustaining capsules for hopping between Exo-Planets. In this aspect Operational research shall be the key towards understanding the Universe.

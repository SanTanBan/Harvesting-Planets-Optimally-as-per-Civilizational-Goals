# Harvesting-Planets-Optimally-as-per-Civilizational-Goals
Developing an optimal strategy for saving Earths Resources is necessary as Humans start the race towards immortality. We need to understand that present research achievements in Reverse Aging shall be able to propel us to survive the test of Time. It is therefore vital to develop an understanding of the Resources we shall need during our journey. It is not possible to shift the entire population from one Start system to the next. We need to divide Objectives and population clusters shall be developing their research based on these objectives. Outliving Time while staying on Earth is one of them. Another Objective may be doing the same on Mars. A hird objective would be to be an eternal traveller and creating smallest self-sustaining capsules for hopping between Exo-Planets. In this aspect Operational research shall be the key.
